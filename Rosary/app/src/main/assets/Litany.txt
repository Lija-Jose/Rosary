Hail, Holy Queen, Mother of Mercy, our life, our sweetness and our hope! 
To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve. 
To thee do we send up our sighs, 
mourning and weeping in this valley of tears! 
Turn, then, O most gracious Advocate, 
thine eyes of mercy toward us, and after this,
our exile, show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb,
Jesus. O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.

V. Pray for us, O holy Mother of God.

R. That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.

Let us Pray. O God, whose only-begotten Son,
by His life, death and resurrection, 
has purchased for us the rewards of eternal life,
grant, we beseech Thee, that meditating on these mysteries
of the most holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary, 
we may imitate what they contain, and obtain what they promise,
through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.

Memorare

Remember, O most gracious Virgin Mary,
that never was it known that anyone who fled to thy protection,
implored thy help, or sought thine intercession was left unaided.
Inspired by this confidence,
I fly unto thee, O Virgin of virgins, my mother;
to thee do I come, before thee I stand, sinful and sorrowful.
O Mother of the Word Incarnate, despise not my petitions,
but in thy mercy hear and answer me.
Amen.
