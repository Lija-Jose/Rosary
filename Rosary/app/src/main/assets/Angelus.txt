In the name of the Father of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen

V. The Angel of the Lord declared unto Mary,
R. And she conceived of the Holy Spirit.

Hail Mary

V. Behold the handmaid of the Lord.
R. Be it done unto me according to Your Word.

Hail Mary

V. And the Word was made flesh,
R. And dwelt among us.

Hail Mary

V. Pray for us, O holy Mother of God.
R. That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.

Let us pray:

Pour forth, we beseech You, O Lord,
Your Grace into our hearts;
that as we have known the incarnation of Christ,
your Son by the message of an angel,
so by His passion and cross
we may be brought to the glory of His Resurrection.
Through the same Christ, our Lord.

Amen.

The Apostles' Creed

I believe in God the Father Almighty,
Creator of heaven and earth; and in Jesus Christ, 
His only Son, our Lord; Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, 
born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified,
died and was buried. He descended into hell. On the third day He arose again;
He ascended into heaven,and seated at the right hand of God, the Father Almighty;
He shall come to judge the living and the dead.
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints,
the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen

1 Our Father

3 Hail Mary
